# Voynich Circuit

guide on how to make a multi layer hybrid paper/fluid/copper circuit.  

## layers 
(from top to bottom)
* ```electronic components``` - an LED, NPN transistor and resistor are soldered to the copper layer
* ```copper``` - using copper tape (with adhesive backing), cut using a stencil cutter. applied with help of transfer tape (low tack tape made specificly to transfer cutout/stencil artwork onto substrate).
* ```stock paper``` - for our color prints we use regualr paper, we use an image editor to trace the fluid channel behinde. we cut using the stencil cutter. see image below 
* ```chromatography paper``` - this paper is the standard when doing paper microfluidics [ebay](http://i.imgur.com/eshUevj.jpg).

## words used

* ```lick-o-meter``` - an LED triggered by a transistor set to sniff for lossly closed cicuits (simple!).  see [lickometer](https://github.com/5shekel/lickometer)
