this is a rough guide of how to make a multi layer hybrid paper/fluid/copper circuit.

layers (from top to bottom)
	electronic components - using the massivly simple lickometer circuit, 
	basicly an LED triggered by a transistor set to sniff for closed cicuits (exsuce the simplification). 
	
	copper - made using copper tape (with adhesive backing), cut using a stencil cutter. 
	applied with help of transfer tape (low tack tape made specificly to transfer cutout/stencil artwork onto substrate).
